  storyText: "Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end up
    dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and patched
    together with plate metal and thick red wires.\r\n\r\nYou have no idea where you
    are. And your head hurts.\r\n\r\nSo, what to do now, slugger?\r\n\r\n1. Wait it
    out. My head hurts.\r\n2. Slam into the door with all my might."
